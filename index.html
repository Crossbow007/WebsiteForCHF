        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Kevin, and I am the founder of C Health
            Food Technology Inc. I am here to share the story of how we started
            a business that produces delicious food products that are healthy
            and gluten-free.
 
            My family and I immigrated to Kingston from China over three years
            ago, and we think it is a beautiful city to be our new home.
            However, we missed our traditional foods in China, especially
            potato noodles, which my wife loved. Fresh potato noodles can not
            be found in Ontario, even if in entire Canada, so we were inspired
            to make our own. As a scientist with a doctorate degree in food s
            cience, I am passionate about creating pioneering food products.
            With my expertise and my wife's love for potato noodles, we have
            developed many brand new recipes that would meet the needs of the
            Chinese and local communities in Ontario.
        </p>


        <p>
            As a team, we worked hard to develop some brand-new recipes for
            Potato Noodles, and Fresh Pasta-like items that are all gluten-
            free, fat-free, and have a nice and chewy texture. Our products
            were well-received by the local community, and our food products
            are now available in over 20 supermarkets in Kingston, Ottawa, and
            Toronto.
 
            We have two types of potato noodles: a wide one that is ideal for
            hotpot and a thin one that is perfect for making noodle dishes.
            Additionally, we are excited to announce that in July we will be
            introducing a new Fresh Pasta-like flavor of noodles that can be
            prepared in just two minutes, with a smooth and chewy texture, that
            would be a great substitution for Pasta.

            We have discovered that there are around one million Chinese people
            and more than 20 million local people in Ontario, and we want to
            serve them all. Therefore, we established a new production
            line that will be more automated and productive.

            Our success is a result of our commitment to delivering high-
            quality and fresh food products to our customers. We hope that our
            story inspires others to follow their passions and never give up on
            their dreams.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you for reading our story, and we look forward to
            sharing our delicious food products with you!
        </p>
