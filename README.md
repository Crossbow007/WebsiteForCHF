# WebsiteForCHF
Build a website for C Health Food Technology Inc.

I have involved a website project for a food company, that my wife and me co-founded last year. My team choose PHP as main programming language, this project gives me a experience as a full-stack developer in the team. From backend to frontend. The using of GitHub, UX, HTML, PHP, CSS and MySQL makes me more confidence and comfortable on website building. I worked with my team members with different parts of the project and troubleshooting when we merge all of our work. And we shared the happiness when our project works well on internet. That is why I enjoy this kind of programs.
